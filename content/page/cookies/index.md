In general this site is optimized to use no cookies other that functional. A functional cookie for example saves whether you selected the dark or the light theme.
However some third party functionality might not share this paradigm. The following sections try to explain the implications of enabling certain features with the toggles. Remember that you can always disable the toggles again and the corresponding third party scripts will no longer be loaded, but also be aware that cookies that those scripts set remain in your browser until you clear them.
