The group of [the Advents Calendar](/post/adventscalendar2023/) is coming back to the Power Platform Learners channel. To get the new year started, the first episode had a pretty open pool of topics and I chose to showcase something from [a recent post](/post/dataflows/deployment/). In the next episode, which should be in February, we will talk about the new release wave announcements.
