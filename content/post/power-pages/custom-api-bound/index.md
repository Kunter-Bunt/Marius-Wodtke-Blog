Custom APIs offer a lot of flexibility, but cannot be called directly from PowerPages. With this video and the accompanying repository/solution, this is going to change! We are going to call custom functionality with an interface that is similar to what you know from the JavaScript of Model-Driven Apps.

This time we are covering how to call bound APIs.
