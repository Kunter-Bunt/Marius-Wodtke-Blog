For the Lead form, we only want to allow entries for persons older than 18 years. A great fit for Client Site Validation, but there is a bug in the code, and the debugging tools are not working correctly! With the usage of Webfiles, we can get a better debugging experience to quickly find the error. And with using Fiddler we can even test some fixes without deploying a change to the server to avoid the time this takes.
